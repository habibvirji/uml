==Device Owner Transfer Method==
note over OT, ND
Find new devices that are unowned and choose the Manufacturer Cert owner transfer method.
end note
OT->ND: GET /oic/sec/doxm?owned=FALSE
ND->OT: RSP {"oxms":[2,...], "owned":FALSE, "deviceuuid":"A21CXXXX-...",...}
OT->ND: POST /oic/sec/doxm {"oxmsel":2}
ND->OT: RSP 2.04

==Perform oic.sec.oxm.mfgcert method==

note over OT, ND
The Manufacturer cert private key is used to sign handshake messages.
Certificate attests device to OBT.
end note
note over OT, ND
If device requires authentication of the OBT, it will resolve the OBT certificate to
 its embedded trust anchor. Otherwise, it will implicitly trust the OBT.
end note

  ND->OT:	ChangeCipherSpec + Finish
end

note over OT, ND
Obtain doxm properties again, using the secure session.
end note
OT->ND: GET /oic/sec/doxm
ND->OT: RSP {"oxms":[2,...], "owned":FALSE, "deviceuuid":"A21CXXXX-...",...}
note over OT, ND
The OBT verifies the doxm properties match those retrieved before the authenticated
connection was established. A mismatch in property values is treated as an authentication error.
end note

note over OT, ND
Verify device supports Client-Directed provisioning, is in "RFOTM" state, and no "dos" change pending.
Onboarding tool tells new device how provisioning will be achieved.
end note
OT->ND: GET /oic/sec/pstat
ND->OT: RSP {"dos":{"s":1,"p":FALSE}, "sm":0bXXXX,X1XX}
OT->ND: POST /oic/sec/pstat {"om":0b0000,0100}
ND->OT: RSP 2.04

note over OT, ND
Onboarding tool posts the device owner UUID.
end note
OT->ND: POST /oic/sec/doxm {"devowneruuid":"B0B0XXXX-..."}
ND->OT: RSP 2.04

note over OT, ND
The OBT establishes owner credentials (see section "Assignment of Owner Credentials")
