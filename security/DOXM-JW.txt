OT->ND: POST /oic/sec/doxm {"oxmsel":0}
ND->OT: RSP 2.04

The OBT verifies the doxm properties match those retrieved before the secure connection
was established. A mismatch in property values is treated as an authentication error.
end note

Verify device supports Client-Directed provisioning, is in "RFOTM" state, and no "dos" change pending.
Onboarding tool tells new device how provisioning will be achieved.

OT->ND: GET /oic/sec/pstat
ND->OT: RSP {"dos":{"s":1,"p":FALSE}, "sm":0bXXXX,X1XX}
OT->ND: POST /oic/sec/pstat {"om":0b0000,0100}
ND->OT: RSP 2.04

note over OT, ND
