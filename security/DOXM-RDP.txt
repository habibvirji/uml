==Device Owner Transfer Method==
note over OT, ND
Find new devices that are unowned and choose the Random PIN owner transfer method.

note over OT, ND
Obtain doxm properties again, using the secure session.
end note
OT->ND: GET /oic/sec/doxm
note over OT, ND
The OBT verifies the doxm properties match those retrieved before the authenticated connection
was established. A mismatch in property values is treated as an authentication error.
end note

note over OT, ND
Verify device supports Client-Directed provisioning, is in "RFOTM" state, and no "dos" change pending.
Onboarding tool tells new device how provisioning will be achieved.
end note
OT->ND: GET /oic/sec/pstat
ND->OT: RSP 2.04

note over OT, ND
Onboarding tool posts the device UUID.
end note
ND->OT: RSP 2.04

note over OT, ND
The OBT establishes owner credentials (see section "Assignment of Owner Credentials")
